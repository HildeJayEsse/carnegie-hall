üõ°Ô∏è Foundational Knowledge Areas for Cybersecurity/InfoSec (with Network Emphasis)
üîπ 1. Networking Fundamentals

    OSI Model (Layers 1‚Äì7)

    TCP/IP stack

    IP addressing and subnetting

    MAC addresses and ARP

    DHCP, DNS, NAT, and routing

    Network topologies (LAN, WAN, VLAN, VPN)

    CIDR notation and subnet masks

    Ports and protocols (TCP/UDP, ICMP, HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SSH, etc.)

    Packet structure and flow

üîπ 2. Network Device Roles & Configuration

    Routers, switches, firewalls, access points

    NICs and interface configuration

    Home vs enterprise network setups

    Static vs dynamic IP assignment

    Common CLI tools: ip, ping, traceroute, netstat, ss, tcpdump, nmap

üîπ 3. Linux & Windows Networking

    How to configure interfaces

    Viewing routing tables and firewall rules

    Managing network services (e.g., sshd, ufw, iptables, firewalld)

    Hostname resolution (/etc/hosts, DNS config)

    Logging and system monitoring (journalctl, syslog, netstat, etc.)

üîπ 4. Network Security Concepts

    Firewalls (host-based and network-based)

    VPNs and encryption protocols (IPSec, SSL/TLS)

    IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems)

    Segmentation and isolation (e.g., DMZs, VLANs)

    Zero Trust networking

üîπ 5. Authentication & Access Control

    MAC filtering

    ACLs (Access Control Lists)

    Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

    Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and certificate use

    Authentication protocols (Kerberos, RADIUS, LDAP)

üîπ 6. Common Attacks and Defenses

    MITM (Man-in-the-Middle)

    Spoofing (ARP, DNS, IP)

    Scanning and enumeration

    DDoS attacks

    Password sniffing/cracking

    Defense mechanisms (e.g., port security, anti-spoofing rules)

üîπ 7. Traffic Analysis and Tools

    Wireshark: packet capture and analysis

    tcpdump: command-line packet capture

    nmap: port scanning and fingerprinting

    Snort/Suricata: intrusion detection

    Log analysis: logs from firewalls, web servers, and routers

üîπ 8. Cyber Hygiene & Hardening

    Disabling unused interfaces/services

    Applying principle of least privilege

    Patching and configuration management

    Secure boot and firmware trust

    Secure protocols (e.g., SFTP over FTP, HTTPS over HTTP)

üîπ 9. Virtualization & Cloud Networking Basics

    Virtual NICs, bridges, and internal networks

    AWS/Azure/GCP network services (VPCs, SGs, routing)

    Cloud-specific security challenges and mitigations

üîπ 10. Legal, Ethical, and Procedural Awareness

    Basic understanding of:

        Pentesting frameworks (e.g., PTES, OWASP)

        Cybersecurity frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)

        Incident response stages

        Ethical hacking principles

        Laws like CFAA and GDPR (depending on your country)

üö¶ Next Steps

To reinforce your learning:

    Start lab work with virtual networks (e.g., using VirtualBox, VMware, or Proxmox)

    Practice with tools like Wireshark, nmap, and iptables

    Set up your own lightweight file server, firewall, or intrusion detection system
